Creating a website to manage wedding invitations. 
The goal is to make a nice frontend, containg a countdown, a timeline with some pictures, and some general information. 
There must also be a backend managing the invitations, saving some form data: Presence, food alergies, transportation, +1s, ... 
Thus, it also needs a database; I've decided to go with a relational database, where we can have already saved guests, with some linked information. 
The database is updated with the data filled in the form. 

I may do an admin page to visualize all the guest info, fetching the data from the database; that still needs to be decided.
