Website for our wedding by Antoine Cochet "Cocheant"

The purpose of this website is to make a nice wedding invitation, as well as a great way to give information to the people who want to come. The website must be in all three languages we have: ES, EN, FR.
The information we want to display: Section about us with a timeline and some photos, Details on the wedding itself: ceremony, party, guest info like languages, photos, etc.. Travel information and what to see there Accomodation
We also want a RSVP system with the number of people coming, food allergies/intolerances, maybe comments, and songs suggestions.

The goal is to make a nice frontend, containg a countdown, a timeline with some pictures, and some general information. 
There must also be a backend managing the invitations, saving some form data: Presence, food alergies, transportation, +1s, ... 
Thus, it also needs a database; I've decided to go with a relational database, where we can have already saved guests, with some linked information. 
The database is updated with the data filled in the form. 

I'm also making an admin page to visualize all the guest info, fetching the data from the database.


Website Frontend made with React, TailwindCSS, ...
